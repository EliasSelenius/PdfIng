	- Right now all rendering is done by the Section class, it should however not be directly responible for 
	  rendering "RenderObjects" like (Text, images, shapes) because:
		* there seems to be a more function based approach rather than object oriented, which gives little flexebility
		* what happens when the position of rendering is relative to something that will be rendered later, how do you move what
		  alredy has been rendered? a real example of this: everything that is rendered in the footer needs to collaps all the way down to the
		  bottom of the page, so how do we do that?
	  we need to use objects, that can store the necessary rendering data, and not render the Section before all RenderObjects are known
	  Needs to be done:
		* Design class architecture for RenderObjects
		* A Section shuold ba a RenderObject
